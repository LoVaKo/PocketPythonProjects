# Pocket Python Projects 
## Tiny python scripts that don't require their own repository.
### About
I've been learning to code using Python and as a result, make quite some small Python scripts. They are usually pretty much self explanatory and don't require many - if any - additional modules. 
- If a program exists of 1 file, it does not get its own folder.
- If a program exists of more than 1 file, everything needed is included in the program folder.
- If a program requires their own README, they get promoted and get their own repository.
